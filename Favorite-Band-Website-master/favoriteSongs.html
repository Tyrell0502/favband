		<p class="songs">GroupLove has had many song releases that made an impact on the charts and in the music community in general. Their songs have been featured in games and TV shows such as NBA 2K11, FIFA 14, Supergirl, PaperTowns, 90210, and Gossip Girl to name a few. Some of their more popular single releases are Colours, Lovely Cup, Iâ€™m with you, Let me in, Traumatized, and Remember That Night. Below I will name a few of my favorite songs and some insight into the meaning behind them. </p>

		

		<div class="songs">
			<p>My favorite songs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="songs">Good Morning (Big Mess) - The song starts off by hinting at being your authentic self, and the troubles that go with that. The chorus of the song is very upbeat and holds alot of meaning, "The night is young, the rest is up to you! Why you gotta say goodmorning? WHy you gotta say goodmorning? Why you gotta?" The band members said themselves that this part of the song was just about not going to sleep, and therefore using your full potential with time.</li>
				<li class="songs">Colours (Never Trust A Happy Song) - This is mainly about appreciating the situation that you are in, despite the circumstances. Christian Zucconi starts the song off from the point of view of someone who "runs around town and act like I dont care". He then goes on to describe pulling some switch, most likely him thinking on his past and how they affected the person that he is today. I enjoy this song because it holds a very positive message about life in general and trying to only look at the positive it has to offer. This is something I try to apply to my way of thinking whenever I can, however it isn't always easy.</li>
				<li class="songs">Sit Still (Spreading Rumours) - To me, this seems like a song that is about always moving forward. It has a motivational tone to it, while also throwing some realizations about the world into the song. One part that made me think is "I can never sit still because the water's always rising, I can never sit stil because I'm afraid of dying". This can mean alot to many people all over the world, giving them the inspiration to go after the goals.</li>
				<li class="songs">Welcome To Your Life (Big Mess) - Being another uplifting song about life, the message of this song is to live to your own personal potential. The group members themselves said that the something they wanted to get across is that life may have their hardships, but it's possible for you to shape it into whatever you want. The line of this song that stuck with me the most, and made it one of my favorites is "Been wondering, I take a chance. That chance is circumstance. Cause nothing ever comes without a chance.</li>
				<li class="songs">Enlighten Me (Big Mess) - The members of Grouplove says that this song is about living in the present. They note that it is easy to live in a place that is neither here nor there, but that shouldn't always be the case. I believe it is important to go after what it is that you want, and it is entirely possible to get stuck behind trying to find answers to questions that may never be answered. A big part of this song is moving forward and past those questions.</li>

				<p>This is a website to showcase some of the history of the band Grouplove. They have been a music group that I've
