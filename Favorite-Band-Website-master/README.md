# Favorite-Band-Website
This is my first website made with vanilla HTML and CSS. I chose the content of the pages to be about different aspects
of my favorite band, Grouplove. I kept it pretty simple when it came to the design of the website, only changing the lining of 
different parts of the site along with the color. I found all of the images of the site through the internet, and the rest of the content
stemmed from my own opinions of the band and their songs.

Hope you enjoy the website, and any and all feedback will be greatly appreciated!
