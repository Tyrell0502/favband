		<p class="individualPar">Based out of Los Angeles, California, Grouplove became a popular in the late 2000’s as an indie rock band. The talented members of the group consist of Hannah Hooper, Christian Zucconi, Sean Gadd, Ryan Robin and Andrew Wessen: each having a very important role in the production of music from the band. Hooper and Zucconi formed a friendship with the remaining three members during an art residency in Greece. From there, they made plans to meet up to discuss music that they had been hoping to make and ended up becoming an official band in the Los Angeles home of Ryan Robin. </p>
		
		<p class="individualPar">Their first official release was an EP named after the band itself, supported by Canvasback in 2010. The remainder of their albums were released in this order: Never Trust a Happy Song, Spreading Rumors, Big Mess, and an EP released in 2017 called Little Mess. One of their most popular songs is called Tongue Tied, which received gold awards from ARIA (Australia Recording Industry Association), and MC (Music Canada), and a platinum award from RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America).</p>

		<p class="individualPar">Throughout the beginning of their music Sean Gadd played the drums for the group, up until late 2013 when he left to work on some of his own projects. Because of this, the band began touring with Daniel Gleason, who eventually became the official drummer for the band. Sean went to twitter to announce his release from the band, tweeting, “I’m so sorry I made a big mistake, I’m making an announcement of why I’m leaving Group love forever x”. This was followed by a post on the band’s website officially announcing his release from the band and his reasoning why.</p>

		<p class="individualPar">The change did not affect the band, or the relationship between the new and former members. They continued to produce great music, and Sean Gadd himself worked on some of his own songs.</p>

				listened to for years now, and their songs got me through some tough periods of time through their message. This is my appreciation to them.</p>
